## Objective
- To compare the performance of different algorithms.
- By comparing the performance of different machine learning algorithms, the model that provides
the highest accuracy was determined.

## Conclusions
- In this study, various machine learning classification algorithms were evaluated for their effectiveness in predicting grain yield. The dataset underwent preprocessing, including imputation of missing values, encoding of categorical variables, and standardization. Feature selection using SelectKBest identified 'VarietyClass_SDV' and 'DaysFromZerotoSowing' as the two most significant predictors.
